*Dr. Kulkarni is a research scientist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the Learning Systems group. Her research spans different aspects of neuromorphic computing including algorithms, applications, simulators, and hardware codesign. She was formerly a postdoc at ORNL advised by Dr. Catherine Schuman, working on different techniques to implement learning to learn framework for neuromorphic computing. She received her PhD in 2019 from New Jersey Institute of Technology with a major in Electrical Engineering under the guidance of Dr. Bipin Rajendran. Her dissertation was on bio-inspired learning and hardware acceleration with emerging memories. She has 19 peer reviewed journal and conference publications.*

*Dr. Ghosh's research focuses on data-driven and machine learning approaches combined with the state-of-the-art first principles methods to study complex material systems. In particular, she has interestsin developing physics-based machine learning frameworks to investigate causal mechanisms in a wide range of materials ranging from inorganic perovskites, actinides, 2D systems to organic crystals and polymers. Bridging the gap between appropriately utilizing data generated by simulations and experiments require a great deal of understanding the nuances present in both fields, which is the goal of her efforts. She received her MS, PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of Connecticut in the summer of2020 and BS in Physics, Abstract Mathematics from the University of Michigan-Flint in spring of 2015.*

*Dr. Kanakkithodi is an assistant professor in Materials Engineering at Purdue
University. He received his PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of
Connecticut in 2017 and worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Nanoscale
Materials in Argonne National Laboratory from 2017 to 2020. His research involves using first
principles computational modeling, machine learning, and materials informatics to drive the
design of new materials for energy-relevant applications. He is a resident associate in the
Nanoscience and Technology Division at Argonne, a regular attendee, presenter, and organizer
at the Materials Research Society (MRS) spring and fall meetings, and a co-organizer of the data
science and machine learning workshop series as part of the NSF-funded nanoHUB.org.*
