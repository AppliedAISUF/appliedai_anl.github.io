*Arun Mannodi Kanakkithodi is an assistant professor in Materials Engineering at Purdue
University. He received his PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of
Connecticut in 2017 and worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Nanoscale
Materials in Argonne National Laboratory from 2017 to 2020. His research involves using first
principles computational modeling, machine learning, and materials informatics to drive the
design of new materials for energy-relevant applications. He is a resident associate in the
Nanoscience and Technology Division at Argonne, a regular attendee, presenter, and organizer
at the Materials Research Society (MRS) spring and fall meetings, and a co-organizer of the data
science and machine learning workshop series as part of the NSF-funded nanoHUB.org.*
