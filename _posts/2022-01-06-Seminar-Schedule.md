## AI-Driven Design of High Entropy Halide Perovskite Alloys

Halide perovskites with desirable stability, electronic structure, and optical absorption are sought
for solar cells, electronic devices, infrared sensors and quantum computing. Compositional
manipulation via alloying at cation or anion sites, or via incorporation of point defects and
impurities, can help tune their properties. In this work, we develop AI-based frameworks for the
on-demand prediction and optimization of the phase stability, band gap, optical absorption spectra,
photovoltaic figures of merit, and defect formation energies for a chemical space of ABX3 halide
perovskites with several choices for A, B and X, with mixing allowed at each site. These
frameworks are powered by high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) computations,
unique encoding of atom-composition-structure (ACS) information, and rigorous training of
advanced neural network (NN)-based predictive models and genetic algorithm (GA)-based multiobjective
optimization frameworks. Our models scale robustly well to large system sizes as well
as varying amounts of mixing of completely new elements at cation or anion sites.
Recommendations from combinatorial screening and GA-based design are synergistically coupled
with targeted synthesis and characterization, leading to successful validation and discovery of
novel halide perovskite compositions for improved performance in solar cells.

*Arun Mannodi Kanakkithodi is an assistant professor in Materials Engineering at Purdue
University. He received his PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of
Connecticut in 2017 and worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Nanoscale
Materials in Argonne National Laboratory from 2017 to 2020. His research involves using first
principles computational modeling, machine learning, and materials informatics to drive the
design of new materials for energy-relevant applications. He is a resident associate in the
Nanoscience and Technology Division at Argonne, a regular attendee, presenter, and organizer
at the Materials Research Society (MRS) spring and fall meetings, and a co-organizer of the data
science and machine learning workshop series as part of the NSF-funded nanoHUB.org.*
